# Learning Materials

I know there are a lot of learning resources in the internet relevant to competitive programming. But too much things at once can be overwhelming sometimes. So, I have compiled and filtered the resources that should help people get started as quickly as possible without much distractions.


## Getting Started

- [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)


## Inspiration and lessons from Pros

- [Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg)
- [Algorithm Live](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBLr7ISa_YDy5qeATupf26w)


## Nothing beats the consistent practice
- [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/tasks/): clear, to the point and quality problems
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset): defacto competitive programming community
- **free advice**: *to get the idea of difficulty see how many people solved the problem, look at tutorial if stuck but always implement the solution yourself once you get the hint or understood the solution. **Implement** the damm thing* 


## Advancing further
- [CP algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
- [e-Maxx](http://e-maxx.ru/algo/) (tip: use google translate extension :P)


## Final Thoughts
Once you get hooked into this thing, you will find a lot of amazing resources along the way besides what I have shared above. But these contents should give you enough foundation to get your hands dirty.
